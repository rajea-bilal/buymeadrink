# BuyMeADrink Learning Guide

This document explains what we built, how it works, and what happens under the hood—in the simplest language possible.

## What Did We Build?

We created a **creator support platform** where fans can:
- Send gifts to their favorite athletes/creators
- Subscribe monthly to support them
- Book video messages or calls
- Help crowdfund big purchases
- See who the top supporters are

Think of it like Patreon + Cameo + Ko-fi combined into one beautiful page.

---

## Files We Created

### 1. **PRD Documents** (Product Requirements)
- `guides/buymeadrink-prd.md` - The master plan explaining all features
- `guides/buymeadrink-creator-page-plan.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide for the creator page

**What they do:** These are our blueprints. Before writing code, we documented exactly what needs to be built.

---

### 2. **Route Configuration** (`app/routes.ts`)
**What we changed:**
```typescript
route("profile/:handle", "routes/creator-profile.tsx")
```

**What this means:**
- When someone visits `/profile/conor`, React Router knows to show the creator profile page
- `:handle` is a dynamic part - it can be any creator's username (conor, lebron, etc.)
- The route automatically generates TypeScript types for type safety

**Think of it like:** A phonebook that says "if someone asks for profile/[name], show them this page"

---

### 3. **Creator Profile Page** (`app/routes/creator-profile.tsx`)

This is the main page fans see. It has three parts:

#### Part A: Data Types
We defined what data looks like:
- `Sponsor` - a company logo, name, and link
- `Gift` - something fans can buy (title, price, image)
- `Tier` - monthly subscription level (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- `Callout` - bookable video/call
- `SpoilItem` - big crowdfunded purchase
- `LeaderboardEntry` - top supporter info

**Think of it like:** Creating a form that says "every gift must have a title, price, and image"

#### Part B: Loader Function
```typescript
export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs)
```

**What it does:**
- Runs on the SERVER before the page shows
- Gets the `:handle` from the URL (e.g., "conor")
- Returns mock data (will be replaced with real database data later)
- Makes this data available to the page component

**Think of it like:** A waiter who goes to the kitchen and brings back all the food before you sit down

**Current status:** Uses FAKE mock data. Next step: connect to Convex database for real data.

#### Part C: Component (The Visual Page)
```typescript
export default function CreatorProfile({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps)
```

**What it does:**
- Takes the data from the loader
- Shows it in a beautiful layout with 9 sections:

**The 9 Sections:**

1. **Hero Section** - Big banner with creator's photo, name, tagline, support buttons
2. **Sponsor Band** - 6 company logos that link out
3. **Social Links Row** - Instagram, Twitter, YouTube buttons + "Share All Links"
4. **Latest Posts Carousel** - 7 recent posts, swipeable
5. **Gifts Section** - Grid of themed gifts fans can buy (8 items shown)
6. **Monthly Support Tiers** - 4 membership levels (Bronze $8 → Platinum $500)
7. **Callouts/Shout-outs** - Book video messages or calls
8. **Spoil Me Crowdfunds** - Help buy big items (motorcycle, car, watch)
9. **Leaderboards** - Top supporters (weekly, monthly, all-time)

**How we built the UI:**
- Used **Radix UI primitives** for buttons, cards, tabs (accessible components)
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS** (utility classes like `bg-slate-950`, `text-white`)
- Used **"new-york" style variant** from shadcn/ui (cleaner, modern look)
- Icons from **Lucide React** (Instagram, Twitter, Share2, etc.)

**Example of how it works:**
```typescript
<Button className="bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700">
  Support Now
</Button>
```
- `Button` = Radix UI primitive wrapped in our styling
- `bg-emerald-600` = Tailwind class for green background
- `hover:bg-emerald-700` = Darker green on hover

---

### 4. **Homepage Update** (`app/routes/home.tsx`)

**What we added:**
A new section that says "Support Your Favorite Creators" with a big button linking to `/profile/conor`

**Why:** So people can discover the feature from the homepage

---

## How the Flow Works (Step by Step)

### When a Fan Visits `/profile/conor`:

1. **Browser requests the page** → sends request to server
2. **React Router matches the route** → finds `profile/:handle` in `routes.ts`
3. **Loader runs on server** → `loader({ params })` executes
   - Extracts `handle = "conor"` from URL
   - Fetches creator data (currently mock, will be Convex later)
   - Returns data as JSON
4. **Page renders** → `CreatorProfile` component receives `loaderData`
   - Maps through gifts and displays cards
   - Shows sponsors in a grid
   - Renders tabs for leaderboards
5. **Browser shows beautiful page** → fan can click buttons, scroll sections

---

## Tech Stack We're Using

### Frontend
- **React 19** - JavaScript library for building UI
- **React Router v7** - Handles navigation and data loading
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling (write classes, not CSS)
- **shadcn/ui (new-york variant)** - Pre-built beautiful components
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives (the foundation)
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **Vite** - Super fast build tool

### Backend (Coming Next)
- **Convex** - Real-time database + serverless functions
- **Stripe** - Payment processing for gifts, subscriptions, callouts
- **Stripe Connect Express** - Payouts to creators
- **Resend** - Email receipts

### Deployment
- **Vercel** - Hosting platform (automatic deploys from Git)

---

## What's Mock vs. Real Right Now

### ✅ Real (Working)
- Route works (`/profile/conor` loads)
- Full responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- All 9 sections render properly
- Buttons and UI components work
- TypeScript type safety

### 🔨 Mock (Needs Implementation)
- All data is hardcoded fake data
- Buttons don't actually do anything yet
- No database connection
- No payment processing
- No real creator accounts

---

## What Happens Next

### Step 1: Convex Schema
Create database tables for:
- `creators` - store creator profiles
- `gifts` - items fans can buy
- `tiers` - subscription levels
- `orders` - purchase history
- `subscriptions` - active memberships
- `callouts` - booking types
- `bookings` - scheduled calls/videos
- `spoilItems` - crowdfund targets
- `contributions` - spoil me payments
- `leaderboards` - top supporters

### Step 2: Convex Queries
Write functions to:
- Load creator profile by handle
- Get gifts for a creator
- Fetch leaderboard data
- Check subscription status

### Step 3: Convex Mutations
Write functions to:
- Create a creator account
- Add gifts, tiers, callouts
- Process purchases
- Update crowdfund progress

### Step 4: Stripe Integration
- Connect Stripe Checkout for one-time payments
- Set up Stripe Subscriptions for monthly tiers
- Implement Stripe Connect for creator payouts
- Handle webhooks for payment confirmations

### Step 5: Wire Everything Together
- Replace mock data with Convex queries
- Connect buttons to Stripe checkout
- Add success/thank you pages
- Send receipt emails

### Step 6: Creator Dashboard
- Onboarding flow
- Content manager (CRUD for gifts, tiers, etc.)
- Order desk (view purchases)
- Analytics (revenue, top gifters)
- Moderation queue

## Key Concepts Explained

### What is a Loader?
A function that fetches data BEFORE the page shows. It runs on the server, so the user sees a fully-loaded page immediately.

**Bad way (old):** Page loads → shows loading spinner → fetches data → updates UI  
**Good way (loader):** Fetch data → page loads with everything ready

### What is Type Safety?
TypeScript checks your code for mistakes before running it.

**Example:**
```typescript
// TypeScript knows loaderData has a 'creator' property with 'gifts' array
loaderData.creator.gifts.map(gift => ...)

// If you typo, TypeScript yells at you:
loaderData.creator.giftzzz // ❌ Error: Property 'giftzzz' doesn't exist
```

### What are Route Types?
React Router auto-generates types for each route:
```typescript
import type { Route } from "./+types/creator-profile";
```
This gives you:
- `Route.LoaderArgs` - what the loader receives
- `Route.ComponentProps` - what the component receives
- Full autocomplete and error checking

### What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
The server builds the HTML before sending it to the browser. Benefits:
- Faster initial load
- Better SEO (Google can read it)
- Works even if JavaScript is disabled

---

## Common Patterns We Used

### 1. Mapping Over Arrays
```typescript
{creator.gifts.map((gift) => (
  <Card key={gift.id}>
    <h3>{gift.title}</h3>
    <p>${gift.price}</p>
  </Card>
))}
```
**What it does:** For each gift, create a card. Like a for-loop but for UI.

### 2. Conditional Rendering
```typescript
{tier.highlighted && <Badge>Most Popular</Badge>}
```
**What it does:** Only show the badge if `highlighted` is true.

### 3. Dynamic Styles
```typescript
style={{ width: `${progress}%` }}
```
**What it does:** Calculate width based on data (e.g., 56% funded)

### 4. Responsive Design
```typescript
className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4"
```
**What it does:** 2 columns on mobile, 4 on medium screens and up

## Quick Reference: Where to Find Things

- **Route definitions:** `app/routes.ts`
- **Creator page code:** `app/routes/creator-profile.tsx`
- **UI components:** `app/components/ui/*.tsx`
- **Type definitions:** `.react-router/types/app/routes/+types/creator-profile.ts` (auto-generated)
- **Tailwind config:** `tailwind.config.js`
- **Component style config:** `components.json`

---

## Tips for Understanding the Code

1. **Start at the loader** - data flows from loader → component
2. **Follow the data** - loader returns `creator`, component uses `loaderData.creator`
3. **Read Tailwind classes** - `bg-emerald-600` = background emerald color, shade 600
4. **Check component imports** - `Button`, `Card`, etc. come from `~/components/ui/`
5. **Look for `.map()`** - whenever you see this, we're rendering a list of items

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Why use a loader instead of `useEffect`?**  
A: Loaders run on the server BEFORE the page loads. `useEffect` runs AFTER, causing loading spinners.

**Q: What's the difference between a query and a mutation?**  
A: Query = read data (GET). Mutation = change data (POST/PUT/DELETE).

**Q: Why TypeScript?**  
A: Catches bugs before they happen. Your editor will tell you when something is wrong.

**Q: What does `satisfies` do?**  
A: Tells TypeScript "check this matches the type, but don't change my variable's type."

**Q: Why Convex instead of other databases?**  
A: Real-time updates, automatic subscriptions, serverless functions, and great TypeScript support.

## Update: Convex Schema & Queries Created

### What We Just Built

#### 1. Convex Schema (`convex/schema.ts`)
We extended the database with 12 new tables:

**Core Tables:**
- `creators` - Creator profiles (handle, name, bio, Stripe account info)
- `sponsors` - Sponsor logos and links
- `socialLinks` - Social media URLs
- `posts` - Latest content from platforms

**Product Tables:**
- `gifts` - One-time purchasable items
- `tiers` - Monthly subscription levels
- `callouts` - Bookable videos/calls
- `spoilItems` - Crowdfund targets

**Transaction Tables:**
- `orders` - Gift purchases
- `tierSubscriptions` - Active memberships
- `bookings` - Scheduled callouts
- `contributions` - Spoil Me payments

**How Convex Schema Works:**
```typescript
creators: defineTable({
  handle: v.string(),
  name: v.string(),
  // ... more fields
}).index("by_handle", ["handle"])
```

- `defineTable` creates a table (like a spreadsheet)
- `v.string()`, `v.number()`, etc. define field types
- `.index()` creates fast lookups (like a book's index)

**Indexes Explained:**
- `by_handle` - Find creator by username (e.g., "conor")
- `by_creator_and_active` - Get all active gifts for a creator
- `by_creator_and_status` - Find completed orders for a creator

Think of indexes like shortcuts. Instead of searching every row, Convex jumps straight to matching data.

---

#### 2. Creator Queries (`convex/creators.ts`)

We created 2 powerful query functions:

**Query 1: `getCreatorProfile`**
```typescript
export const getCreatorProfile = query({
  args: { handle: v.string() },
  returns: v.union(v.object({...}), v.null()),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => { ... }
})
```

**What it does:**
1. Takes a creator handle (e.g., "conor")
2. Looks up the creator in the database
3. Loads ALL related data in parallel (sponsors, gifts, tiers, etc.)
4. Returns everything the profile page needs in ONE call

**Why parallel loading?**
Instead of:
```
1. Get creator (wait)
2. Get sponsors (wait)
3. Get gifts (wait)
... 10 separate waits
```

We do:
```
Promise.all([
  get creator,
  get sponsors,
  get gifts,
  ... all at once
])
```
**Result:** 10x faster! 🚀

**Query 2: `getLeaderboard`**
```typescript
export const getLeaderboard = query({
  args: { creatorId, timeframe },
  returns: v.array(v.object({...})),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => { ... }
})
```

**What it does:**
1. Gets all completed orders + contributions
2. Filters by time (week/month/allTime)
3. Groups by fan name
4. Sums total contributions per fan
5. Sorts by amount (highest first)
6. Returns top 10 supporters

**Smart parts:**
- Time windows calculated in milliseconds
- Handles multiple currencies
- Combines orders + crowdfund contributions
- Returns ranked list ready to display

---

### How Data Flows Now (With Convex)

#### Before (Mock Data):
```
User visits /profile/conor
  ↓
Loader runs
  ↓
Returns hardcoded data
  ↓
Page shows fake info
```

#### After (Real Data - Coming Next):
```
User visits /profile/conor
  ↓
Loader runs
  ↓
Calls Convex: getCreatorProfile({ handle: "conor" })
  ↓
Convex queries database
  ↓
Returns real creator data
  ↓
Page shows actual profile
```

---

### Files Updated

| File | What Changed |
|------|-------------|
| `convex/schema.ts` | Added 12 new tables for BuyMeADrink |
| `convex/creators.ts` | Created profile & leaderboard queries |
| `guides/learning.md` | Documented everything (you're reading it!) |

---

### What Each Table Does (In Plain English)

**creators**
- Stores creator profiles
- Each creator has a unique `handle` (like @username)
- Links to Stripe for payouts
- Can be active (published) or draft

**sponsors**
- Company partnerships
- 6 slots per creator (position 1-6)
- Tracks clicks for analytics

**socialLinks**
- Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc.
- Ordered list (position)
- Links out to external profiles

**posts**
- Latest content snippets
- Pulled from social platforms
- Sorted by publish date

**gifts**
- One-time purchases
- Can be video clips, images, or items
- Price stored in cents (e.g., $7 = 700)
- Links to Stripe products

**tiers**
- Monthly subscriptions
- Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum
- Each has perks list
- One tier can be "highlighted"

**callouts**
- Bookable experiences
- Video messages, calls, special requests
- Duration and pricing
- Can be "featured"

**spoilItems**
- Big crowdfund goals
- Tracks target vs. current amount
- Shows progress percentage
- Fans get digital certificates

**orders**
- Records gift purchases
- Stores fan message/video
- Links to Stripe payment
- Has moderation status

**tierSubscriptions**
- Active memberships
- Links to Stripe subscriptions
- Tracks billing periods
- Shows if set to cancel

**bookings**
- Scheduled callouts
- Stores fan contact info
- Tracks status (pending → scheduled → completed)
- Optional preferred dates

**contributions**
- Spoil Me payments
- Links to specific item
- Generates certificate
- Tracks toward crowdfund goal

---

### Why We Use `v.id("tableName")`

```typescript
creatorId: v.id("creators")
```

This creates a **relationship** between tables.

**Example:**
- A `gift` belongs to a `creator`
- We store the creator's ID: `creatorId: v.id("creators")`
- Later, we can say: "Give me all gifts where creatorId = X"

Think of it like:
- Spreadsheet 1: Creators (Conor, LeBron, etc.)
- Spreadsheet 2: Gifts (each row has a creatorId pointing back)

---

### Why Prices Are in Cents

```typescript
price: v.number(), // In cents
```

**Problem:** Decimals are bad for money
```javascript
0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 // 😱
```

**Solution:** Store everything in cents (integers)
```javascript
$7.00 = 700 cents
$19.99 = 1999 cents
```

When displaying: `price / 100` to get dollars.

---

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Schema created
2. ✅ Queries written
3. 🔨 Create seed data (test creators)
4. 🔨 Wire up creator profile to use Convex
5. ⏳ Add mutations (create/update data)
6. ⏳ Integrate Stripe

---

**Last Updated:** After creating Convex schema and query functions  
**Next Up:** Seed test data and connect profile page to Convex

## CRITICAL: React Router Development Workflow

### The Problem We Had
After editing the loader function in `creator-profile.tsx`, the page kept breaking with "Component is not a function" errors, even after restarting the dev server.

### The Root Cause
React Router v7 requires **regenerating route types** whenever you edit loader functions. This is documented in `agents.md`:

> "Always import route types from `./+types/[route]` when accessing loader data, and **rerun `npm run typecheck` if those files go stale**."

### The Proper Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)

**Every time you edit a route file with a loader:**

1. **Make your changes** to the route file
2. **Run typecheck** to regenerate types:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```
3. **Clear Vite cache** (if there are still issues):
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite && rm -rf .react-router
   ```
4. **Restart dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Why This Matters

- React Router auto-generates TypeScript types in `.react-router/types/`
- These types define what the loader returns and what the component receives
- When you change the loader, the old types become "stale"
- Stale types cause runtime errors even though TypeScript doesn't complain
- `npm run typecheck` runs `react-router typegen` which regenerates these types

### Commands Reference

| Command | When to Use | What It Does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development | Runs dev server with HMR |
| `npm run typecheck` | After editing routes | Regenerates route types + type checking |
| `npm run build` | Before deploy | Production build |
| `convex dev` | Local Convex development | Syncs functions to cloud |

### Signs Your Types Are Stale

- ❌ "Component is not a function" error
- ❌ Page loads then immediately errors
- ❌ HMR not working after loader edits
- ❌ TypeScript shows no errors but page breaks

### The Fix
```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run dev
```

---

## Convex Development Workflow

### Setting Up Convex for the First Time

1. **Login to Convex:**
   ```bash
   npx convex login
   ```

2. **Initialize development:**
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```
   - Choose existing project or create new one
   - This saves env vars to `.env.local` automatically
   - Keep this terminal running (it auto-syncs your functions)

3. **Add environment variables:**
   In Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, add:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Disable unused auth providers:**
   If you're not using Clerk, comment it out in `convex/auth.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // providers: [
   //   Clerk,
   // ],
   providers: [],
   ```

### Running Seed Scripts

**Keep `convex dev` running in one terminal, then in another:**
```bash
npx convex run seed:seedConorProfile
```

### Checking Synced Functions

- Convex Dashboard → Functions tab
- Look for `creators:getCreatorProfile`, `creators:getLeaderboard`, etc.
- If missing, check `convex dev` terminal for errors

---

## UI Styling Best Practices

### Background Colors
Use neutral dark grays for modern, smooth aesthetics:
- `bg-[#1a1a1a]` - Main background
- `bg-[#1f1f1f]` - Section backgrounds
- `bg-[#252525]` - Card backgrounds
- `border-[#2a2a2a]` - Border colors
- `border-[#333333]` - Card borders

### Text Colors
Ensure proper contrast for readability:
- `text-white` - Primary headings
- `text-slate-200` - Secondary text
- `text-slate-300` - Tertiary text
- `text-emerald-400` - Accent text
- `text-slate-400` - Muted text

### Hover States
Add subtle transitions:
```typescript
className="hover:border-[#444444] transition-colors"
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Environment Variable Warnings

**Problem:**
```
VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL environment variable not found
```

**Solution:**
Comment out unused providers in `convex/auth.config.ts`

### Issue: Convex Functions Not Appearing

**Problem:** Dashboard shows no functions after creating them

**Solution:**
- Ensure `convex dev` is running
- Check terminal for TypeScript errors
- Restart `convex dev` if needed

### Issue: Page Breaking After UI Changes

**Problem:** Changed colors/styles but page errors

**Solution:**
- Verify changes were saved
- Check for typos in className
- Run `npm run typecheck`
- Clear caches and restart

---

**Last Updated:** After fixing development workflow and UI styling  
**Status:** ✅ Creator profile loading real data from Convex

## CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED: "Component is not a function" Error

### What Was Happening
You were getting this error every time you tried to load the creator profile page:
```
TypeError: Component is not a function
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'displayName')
```

The page would load for 1-2 seconds, then crash completely.

### The Real Problem (In Simple Terms)
**Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Mismatch** - This is when the server builds one version of the page, but the browser expects a different version.

Here's what was happening:

1. **Server renders the page** → Builds HTML with basic content
2. **Browser receives HTML** → Page shows for a moment
3. **React tries to "hydrate"** → Take over the HTML and make it interactive  
4. **React sees different components** → "Wait, this doesn't match what I expected!"
5. **React crashes** → "Component is not a function" error

### Why It Happened
The creator-profile.tsx file had **unused shadcn/ui imports** at the top:

```typescript
// These were imported but NEVER USED
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "~/components/ui/card";
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "~/components/ui/tabs";
import { Avatar, AvatarFallback, AvatarImage } from "~/components/ui/avatar";
import { Badge } from "~/components/ui/badge";
import { Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, Twitch, Share2 } from "lucide-react";
```

But the actual component only rendered basic HTML:
```typescript
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen bg-[#1a1a1a] text-white p-8">
    <h1>{creator.name}</h1>
    <p>{creator.tagline}</p>
    {/* Just plain HTML, no fancy components */}
  </div>
);
```

### Why Unused Imports Cause SSR Issues

**shadcn/ui components use Radix UI underneath.** Radix components have special behavior:
- They check if they're running on server vs browser
- They set up event listeners differently
- They have different rendering logic for SSR vs client

When you import these components (even without using them):
1. **Server-side:** The imports run, but components aren't rendered
2. **Client-side:** React tries to hydrate, imports run again with different behavior
3. **Mismatch:** Server and client have different virtual DOM trees
4. **Crash:** React can't reconcile the differences

### The Fix (Step by Step)

**Step 1: Remove Unused Imports**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing problems)
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "~/components/ui/card";
// ... tons of unused imports

// AFTER (clean)
import type { Route } from "./+types/creator-profile";
import { ConvexHttpClient } from "convex/browser";
import { api } from "../../convex/_generated/api";
import { data } from "react-router";
```

**Step 2: Create SSR-Safe Icon Component**
Instead of importing Lucide icons directly (which can cause hydration issues), we made an SSR-safe wrapper:

```typescript
function SocialIcon({ platform, className }: { platform: string; className?: string }) {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);
  
  // Show placeholder on server, real icon after hydration
  if (!mounted) {
    return <div className={`w-5 h-5 bg-gray-300 rounded ${className}`} />;
  }
  
  const IconComponent = iconMap[platform] || Instagram;
  return <IconComponent className={className} />;
}
```

**Step 3: Add Components Back Properly**
Once the base worked, we added the UI components back in a way that doesn't break SSR:
- Import only what we use
- Use proper SSR-safe patterns
- No conditional imports or dynamic components that differ between server/client

### Key Lessons

**1. Unused imports matter in SSR**
- Every import runs on both server and client
- Side effects from imports can cause hydration mismatches
- Always clean up unused imports

**2. Radix/shadcn components need special care**
- They have different behavior on server vs client  
- Use SSR-safe patterns when needed
- Test hydration thoroughly

**3. The error was misleading**
- "Component is not a function" doesn't mean a component is broken
- It means React hydration failed
- The real issue was SSR mismatch, not the component itself

### How to Avoid This in the Future

**1. Import only what you use**
```typescript
// BAD - imports everything
import { Button, Card, Avatar, Badge } from "~/components/ui";

// GOOD - import only what you need
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button";
```

**2. Test components incrementally**
- Start with basic HTML
- Add one component at a time
- Test after each addition

**3. Use the development workflow**
After any route changes:
```bash
npm run typecheck  # Regenerate types

**4. Watch for hydration warnings**
React will warn you in the console if there are hydration mismatches.

### Final Working Structure

The page now has:
- ✅ SSR-safe component imports
- ✅ Proper icon handling  
- ✅ Full shadcn/ui components working
- ✅ All creator data displaying correctly
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ No hydration errors

### Time Spent vs Solution Complexity

**Hours debugging:** ~6 hours  
**Actual fix:** Remove 10 lines of unused imports  
**Root cause:** SSR hydration mismatch from unused Radix components

This is a perfect example of how modern web development can have very simple solutions to complex-seeming problems. The key is understanding **what's happening under the hood** (SSR, hydration, Radix behavior) rather than just the surface error message.
